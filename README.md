# HARNESSING HYPERBOLIC GEOMETRY FOR HARMFUL PROMPT DETECTION AND SANITIZATION

This repository contains code for the paper "Harnessing Hyperbolic Geometry for Harmful Prompt Detection and Sanitization". The project explores the use of hyperbolic geometry to detect and sanitize prompts with harmful intent.

## HyPE and HyPS Architecture

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python (version 3.10 or higher recommended)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Common ML libraries: `numpy`, `torch`, etc.

(See individual notebooks or requirements files for additional dependencies.)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Maljak10010111/Diffusion-Models-Embedding-Space-Defense.git
    cd Diffusion-Models-Embedding-Space-Defense
    ```
2. Create and activate a virtual conda environment:
   ```bash
   conda create -n defense python=3.10
   conda activate defense
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

To run HyPE inference please use HyPE_inference.py script that is a minimal example of how to use the HyPE model for harmful prompt detection.
